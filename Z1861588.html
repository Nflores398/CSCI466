        <p>Today I will be telling you about the coolest video game ever. This game is called Persona 4 Golden on the PS Vita and Steam.<br/>The game is about a group of friends going on a mission to solve a murder/disappearance case in their small town.<br/> The friends must go inside the TV world to save these people and eventually find out who is responsible for the disappearances.<br/>This a game you canâ€™t skip!</p>
        <p>Now I will give a review of the Movie The Room. The Movie is about a young handsome dude name Johnny. <br/> Who is living his life to the fullest. One day he finds out that darling Lisa is cheating on him with his best friend Mark. <br/>This movie is a classic and should be watched at least once. </p>
